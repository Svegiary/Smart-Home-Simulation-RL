# ai2cyber small project

## Overview

This is a simple Smart Home Simulation project. The implementation supports building a home that has room, 
each room has devices and sensors and a human inside. The goal of this project is to train an ai agent
that takes the right actions to maximize user comfort and minmize power consumption.

There are external variables such as outside temp, outside humidity and sunlight that affect the internal measurements

## Structure

# Device
There are 3 devices. A light , an ac and a dehumidifier. A user can control these devices in order to achieve efficiency and comfort.
Each device has a unique influence on the simulation combined with external variables
