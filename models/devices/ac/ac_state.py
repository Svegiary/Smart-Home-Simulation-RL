-ACState.py
This file containts the concrete implementation of an ACState class
and its discrete concrete statesS
Its' responsibilities:
1) Implement a common interface for all AC States from the Device State class
2) Implement concrete states of the device and their methods
3) Calculate power consumption for each state
